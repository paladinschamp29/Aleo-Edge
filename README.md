# Aleo Edge README

Aleo Edge is an intelligent AI powered extension to Visual Studio code for delivering an enhanced, secure, in-line help experience to the Aleo developer.


## Features

We have full syntax highlighting and added 10 powerful features.
* The first set is formatting the code with tabs and spaces and adding extra lines before code blocks.
* The second set is about adding automated file headers and a  wiki type inline commenting.
* The third set is about code predictions along with aleo intelligence.
* The fourth set is about linting for secure coding along with proper coding guide lines.
* The 5th set is about inline help, as we hover on aleo keywords.
